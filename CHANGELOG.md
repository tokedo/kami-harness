# Changelog

All notable changes to the **Kamigotchi environment interface** — the MCP
server surface that KamiBench agents build against — are documented here.

The version tracked here is `SCHEMA_VERSION` (see
[`executor/schema_version.py`](executor/schema_version.py)). It is surfaced
to clients as the MCP `server_version` in the initialize handshake, and it
is distinct from git tags: git tags mark repository states, `SCHEMA_VERSION`
marks the tool contract.

## Versioning policy (semver)

`SCHEMA_VERSION` follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org):

- **MAJOR** — a breaking change to an existing tool: a renamed or removed
  tool, a changed or removed parameter, or changed semantics/return shape
  that existing callers relied on. Agents must be updated.
- **MINOR** — additive, backward-compatible changes: a new tool, or a new
  *optional* parameter on an existing tool. Existing agents keep working.
  This is the expected path for future studies.
- **PATCH** — non-semantic changes: documentation fixes, wording, catalog
  data refreshes, internal refactors that do not change the tool contract.

## [1.0.0] — Environment-interface baseline

First release of `kami-harness` as a pure environment interface for
KamiBench. Establishes the versioned tool contract.

### Changed
- Repurposed the repo from an agent-with-policy harness into a pure
  **environment interface**: mechanics (tool schemas, catalogs, system
  docs, integration references) stay; agent policy (strategy, memory
  schema, decision procedures, operating-mode runners) was removed.
- Rewrote every MCP tool description to be **descriptive, not
  prescriptive**: each states what the tool does, its inputs/outputs, and
  the world mechanics it touches — not when or why an agent should use it.
- Rewrote `README.md` as an interface specification.
- Reworked `SETUP.md` to cover only environment setup (server + client).

### Removed (relocated to `migration/to-kami-agent/`)
- `strategies/` — calibrated decision heuristics.
- `CLAUDE.md` — playing-agent instructions and per-tick decision priorities.
- `systems/memory.md` — agent memory schema and templates.
- The per-tick decision checklist and strategy/memory layer prose from the
  README; the Hybrid/Autonomous operating-mode narrative from SETUP.
- The autonomous session runner and prompt templates.

See [`migration/judgment-sweep.md`](migration/judgment-sweep.md) for the
full record of every judgment sentence removed and its source location.

### Added
- `SCHEMA_VERSION` (`executor/schema_version.py`), surfaced via MCP
  `server_version`.
- This `CHANGELOG.md` and its versioning policy.

### Tool surface
- 64 MCP tools across setup, reads, on-chain actions, batch wrappers,
  quests, scavenge, and trading. Unchanged in count and behavior from the
  `v0-pilot` state — only descriptions were rewritten.
